# 👋 Hi, I'm Sid Richards
**Aspiring Quantum Computing Engineer**
Focused on quantum algorithms (VQE, QPE, Shor), numerical simulation, and physics-driven modelling.

I have a First-Class MSci in Theoretical Physics & Mathematics and I build research-grade, well-structured open-source projects across quantum computing, photonics, numerical methods, and applied optimisation.
My work spans quantum chemistry, quantum error mitigation, classical simulations of quantum algorithms, and high-performance scientific modelling.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

[**Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) & Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)**](https://github.com/SidRichardsQuantum/Variational_Quantum_Eigensolver)
A modular PennyLane-based package for VQE and QPE applied to H₂, LiH, H₂O and H₃⁺.
Features a full VQE engine with ansatz modules, optimisers, caching, reproducibility tests, molecular Hamiltonian generation, visualisation tools, and parallel QPE simulations (noisy and noiseless).
Published on PyPI at [https://pypi.org/project/vqe-pennylane/](https://pypi.org/project/vqe-pennylane/)

[**Portfolio Optimisation via VQE**](https://github.com/SidRichardsQuantum/VQE_Portfolio_Optimization)
A quantum optimisation project mapping portfolio selection to a QUBO and solving it with VQE.
Includes binary-encoded and fractional-ansatz approaches using PennyLane, with full derivations and results.
Published on PyPI at [https://pypi.org/project/vqe-portfolio/](https://pypi.org/project/vqe-portfolio/)

[**Dynamics of Topological Photonics**](https://github.com/SidRichardsQuantum/Dynamics_of_Topological_Photonics)
A full simulation suite exploring nonlinear gain/loss, edge modes, and stability regimes in non-Hermitian topological lattices (NRSSH & Diamond models).
Includes phase diagrams, time-evolution solvers, Hamiltonian construction, and analysis relevant to photonics, nonlinear optics, and topological quantum systems.
This is revamped code from my uni dissertation: "Dynamics of Topological Photonics with Nonlinear Saturable Gain and Loss".

[**Shor’s Algorithm – Classical Quantum Circuit Simulation**](https://github.com/SidRichardsQuantum/Shors_Algorithm_Simulation)
A pure-Python, matrix-based classical simulation of Shor’s quantum factoring algorithm.
Implements superposition, modular exponentiation, IQFT, probability visualisation, runtime scaling, and educational tooling without relying on quantum frameworks.

[**Celestial Dynamics – Iteration Methods Comparison**](https://github.com/SidRichardsQuantum/Celestial_Dynamics_Iteration_Methods)
A numerical physics project comparing Euler, Midpoint, Heun, and RK4 schemes through gravitational simulations.
Includes projectile motion, two-body and three-body orbits, chaos behaviour, and energy-conservation analysis implemented primarily in R Code.

[**Quantum Error Correction (Work in Progress)**](https://github.com/SidRichardsQuantum/Quantum_Error_Correction)
Explores the fundamentals of quantum error correction and early implementations of small error-correcting codes.
A growing project aligned with my long-term interest in fault-tolerant quantum computing.

[**Quantum Linear Solver (Work in Progress)**](https://github.com/SidRichardsQuantum/Quantum_Linear_Algebra_Algorithms)
A developing repository implementing quantum linear-system solvers using concepts from block-encoding, QSVT, and HHL-style formulations.
Designed to complement my VQE/QPE work with more advanced quantum algorithmic techniques.
